<h1> ðŸ”‘ Keylogger â€“ Python</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
A keylogger is a software or hardware tool designed to record keystrokes entered on a computer or mobile device. Its primary function is to monitor keyboard activity, which may include typed text, website interactions, application usage, clipboard contents, and more. Some keyloggers also capture screenshots to provide visual context of user behavior. They can log sensitive data such as email communications, chat messages, and confidential information like passwords or credit card numbers. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is both illegal and unethical.

<br />
The referenced code demonstrates how to implement a keylogger that captures and displays keystrokes in real-time while logging them to a file named keyfile.txt. This type of tool should only be used for authorized security research or educational purposes within legal boundaries. To defend against keyloggers and similar threats, users should keep systems updated, use strong passwords, avoid suspicious files and links, and rely on reputable antivirus and anti-malware solutions.
